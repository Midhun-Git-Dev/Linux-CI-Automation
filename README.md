# Linux CI Automation Pipeline

## 📖 Project Description
Linux CI Automation Pipeline is a Continuous Integration (CI) project that automates system-level checks using Linux shell scripts and Jenkins.  
Whenever the code is fetched from GitHub, Jenkins executes Bash scripts to validate system health, disk usage, and service status.

This project focuses only on **CI (Continuous Integration)** and does not include deployment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
- Automate Linux system checks
- Practice real-world CI workflow
- Integrate Linux, Bash, Git, GitHub, and Jenkins
- Learn how Jenkins handles success and failure using exit codes

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- Linux
- Bash Scripting
- Git
- GitHub
- Jenkins (Freestyle Job)

---

## ⚙️ What This Project Does
- Checks CPU and memory usage
- Monitors disk usage threshold
- Verifies running system services
- Generates logs for every CI run
- Fails the Jenkins build if any check fails

---

## 🧠 Use Case
This project can be used to:
- Monitor basic system health in CI pipelines
- Validate scripts before moving to deployment
- Learn CI fundamentals for DevOps beginners
- Simulate real-world DevOps automation workflows

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Simple and beginner-friendly
- Uses real DevOps tools and workflow
- Easy to extend with more scripts
- Clear CI success/failure visibility
- Resume and portfolio ready

---

## ⚠️ Disadvantages / Limitations
- No Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Manual Jenkins setup (no Jenkinsfile yet)
- Limited to basic system checks
- No containerization (Docker not included)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code)
- Enable GitHub webhook for auto-trigger
